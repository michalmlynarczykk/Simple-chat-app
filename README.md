# My simple chat app 
I create a simple flask-based chat app, I was curious how to connect two or more computers on my website, 
so I chose to jump into this rabbit hole. I figured out that I can use Flask-SokcetIO library to achieve this.

## Technologies
Stack that I was using for this project consists of:
- HTML
- CSS (file written on my own and some bootstrap templates)
- JavaScript (jQuery)
- Python (Flask)
- Sqlite3
- other smaller libraries

## How to run
pull repository and install (with pip install) all files from requirements.txt
